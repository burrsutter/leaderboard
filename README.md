# scoreboard
A scoreboard for the mobile app game.

Installation:

```
cd scoreboard/
npm install
```

There are three ways in which you can build and run the web app:

* Build once:
    * `npm run build`
    * Open `index.html`
* Watch files continuously, rebuild incrementally, whenever one of them changes:
    * `npm run watch`
    * Open `index.html`, manually reload page in browser whenever there was a change
* Hot reloading server:
    * `npm start`
    * Chrome should open automatically and go to `http://localhost:8080/`, page reloads automatically when there are changes
    * (if it doesn't reload, make sure you save it)
